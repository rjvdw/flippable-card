## Build

To build the JavaScript version of your component:

```bash
npm run build
```

To watch files and rebuild when the files are modified, run the following command in a separate shell:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

## Dev Server

This sample uses modern-web.dev's [@web/dev-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@web/dev-server) for previewing the project without additional build steps. Web Dev Server handles resolving Node-style "bare" import specifiers, which aren't supported in browsers. It also automatically transpiles JavaScript and adds polyfills to support older browsers. See [modern-web.dev's Web Dev Server documentation](https://modern-web.dev/docs/dev-server/overview/) for more information.

To run the dev server and open the project in a new browser tab:

```bash
npm run serve
```

There is a development HTML file located at `/dev/index.html` that you can view at http://localhost:8000/dev/index.html. Note that this command will serve your code using Lit's development mode (with more verbose errors). To serve your code against Lit's production mode, use `npm run serve:prod`.
